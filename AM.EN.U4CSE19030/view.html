 <ul><li>If you love yourself, if you respect yourself, if you believe in yourself and your dream, NOTHING can stop you.It all depends on your attitude towards life.</li>
<li>Thomas Jefferson said: “Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude, and nothing can help the man with the wrong attitude.”</li>
<li>Have a positive attitude towards life. Don’t be afraid of stumbling and falling.Failure isn’t falling down; it is staying down. If you fall, get up and move on.Forget about obstacles.</li>
<li> As Henry Ford said, “Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.”</li>
<li>Never let anybody tell you that something is impossible.You can change the world if you set your mind to it. Believe me, you can. Start slowly, but surely, and you will see your dreams come to life.</li>
